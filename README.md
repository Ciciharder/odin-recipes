Odin-Recipes
This is my first project for the Odin Project Foundations Course. I have created an index.html document to link to a Waffle Fry recipe. In the waffle_fries.html document you will find a recipe for Waffle Fries which includes an image, a list of ingredients, and a list of steps to prepare them.
