        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
            These waffle fries are super crunchy, almost like shoestring potatoes, and served with a yummy homemade dipping sauce. A great snack for game night or as a side for burgers.
            </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
                <li>Peanut or vegetable oil for frying</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp salt or desired seasoning</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (400 degrees C). Set two wire racks atop paper towels.</li>
                <li>Fill a large bowl with ice water. Using a mandoline with a waffle blade set to 1/4-inch, slice potatoes crosswise, then rotate 90Â° and make another slice for each waffle fry (you can also use a crinkle cutter using the same process).</li>
                <li>Add cut waffle fries to the ice water as they are done.</li>
                <li>In a large heavy saucepan, add 2 inches of oil. Clip a candy/oil thermometer to the side of the pan. Heat oil over medium heat to 310 degrees F (155 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Drain waffle fries and blot dry with paper towels.</li>
                <li>Working in batches, fry waffle fries 4 to 5 minutes. They should just cook through at this point, but not brown.</li>
                <li>Remove from oil with a slotted spoon and place on wire racks.</li>
                <li>Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Add waffle fries in batches and cook 1 to 2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with salt. Transfer cooked fries to the oven to keep warm while frying remaining waffle fries.</li>
            </ol>
